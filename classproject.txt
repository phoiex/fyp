Business process
The business process mainly includes developing an efficient shopping website, involving tasks such as product display, user account management, shopping cart function and payment integration. The current focus is on backend API and database integration, and the subsequent focus will be further on UI/UX design, security compliance and performance optimization.

User needs
Users need a responsive and intuitive shopping site that supports easy navigation, secure transactions and a smooth checkout process. The site should also support multiple payment methods and be updated in real time through an integrated product catalog and inventory management system.

Non-functional requirements
The website loading time should be controlled within 2 seconds, and it should be well adapted to mobile devices and can be accessed smoothly on multiple devices. The website should support high traffic access with minimal downtime and have good scalability to cope with future growth. The design needs to meet user-friendliness and accessibility standards.

User roles and permissions
The system needs to support different user roles, including customers, administrators, and guests. Customers can view products, make purchases, and manage their personal accounts; administrators can manage product lists, orders, and user data. The system must ensure that permission management is properly implemented to ensure data privacy and security.

System integration
The project will integrate third-party systems, such as payment gateways, to ensure transaction security. Integration with inventory management systems ensures real-time updates of products and accuracy of inventory data. In addition, the stability and availability of external APIs (such as payment processing systems) must be guaranteed.

Technical architecture
The system architecture consists of a front-end user interface and a back-end database. The front-end uses a responsive web design, and the back-end uses a secure database to store user, product, and transaction data. The system will be hosted on a reliable cloud platform to ensure good scalability and high availability.

Data management
Data management involves the secure storage and processing of user data, including personal information and transaction details. Data protection regulations must be followed to ensure that user data is secure and privacy is protected.

UI/UX design
UI/UX design will focus on providing an easy-to-navigate interface to enhance the shopping experience. The front-end design will be optimized for desktop and mobile to ensure that users can quickly browse, add products to the shopping cart and complete the purchase smoothly.

Security Compliance
The website must meet security standards to ensure transaction security and prevent data breaches. It must also comply with relevant security regulations and standards such as GDPR, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), and SSL encryption.

Acceptance criteria
The project was considered successful if the website was fully functional, secure and user-friendly. Key acceptance criteria included a minimum of 85% user satisfaction, secure payment processing and smooth website performance without critical errors or downtime.

Project budget
The budget is limited by available resources and needs to cover the costs of website development, design, hosting, security implementation, and third-party services (such as payment gateways). Budget allocation will prioritize backend development and core functionality, and may limit the implementation of some advanced features in the initial stage.

Project timeline
The project timeline is 6 months, with key milestones including backend development, frontend design, performance optimization and testing. The project is expected to be completed on July 19, 2025, and all major tasks will be completed within this time frame to ensure on-time launch.

Risk management
Risk management includes identifying potential issues such as feedback delays, server availability issues, or third-party API integration issues. The project team will mitigate these risks by maintaining clear communication with stakeholders and ensuring that resources are allocated on time.

Post-deployment support
Post-deployment support will include monitoring site performance, handling bug fixes, and providing updates when necessary. The site will be maintained to ensure it runs smoothly and provides a good user experience in the long term.

Legal Compliance
The project will ensure compliance with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including data protection laws, e-commerce regulations and payment security standards. The website will implement the necessary privacy policies and user agreements to comply with these legal obligations.
